# Ankh
An in-game timer and autosplitter for Balatro.

## Installation
Ankh requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) to be installed in order to be used. To install it, you must copy `dwmapi.dll` into your Balatro game directory. You can navigate to the location by right-clicking the game in Steam, hovering "Manage", and selecting "Browse local files".

To install Ankh, move the files from the latest [Release](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Ankh/releases) into the `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods` folder. (You must create this folder if it does not exist.)

For autosplitting with LiveSplit, you must also install [LiveSplit Server](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server/releases/tag/1.8.19). Move the files from this release into your LiveSplit Components folder and add LiveSplit Server to your splits layout.
