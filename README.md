# Ankh
An in-game timer and autosplitter for Balatro.

## Installation
The latest version of Ankh can be installed with Thunderstore - you can find the mod [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/balatro/p/MathIsFun0/Ankh).

For autosplitting with LiveSplit, you must also install [LiveSplit Server](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server/releases/tag/1.8.19). Move the files from this release into your LiveSplit Components folder and add LiveSplit Server to your splits layout.

## Using Ankh
All runs uploaded to Speedrun.com with this mod must use its Official Mode, which you can find in the profile selection menu.
To reset runs with multiple segments, hold down Control+R instead of just R.
