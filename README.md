# Ankh
An in-game timer and autosplitter for Balatro.

## Installation
Ankh requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) to be installed in order to be used. To install it, you must copy `dwmapi.dll` into your Balatro game directory. You can navigate to the location by right-clicking the game in Steam, hovering "Manage", and selecting "Browse local files".

To install Ankh, move the files from the latest [Release](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Ankh/releases) into the `%AppData%/Balatro/Mods` folder. (You must create this folder if it does not exist.)

For autosplitting with LiveSplit, you must also install [LiveSplit Server](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.Server/releases/tag/1.8.19). Move the files from this release into your LiveSplit Components folder and add LiveSplit Server to your splits layout.

Ankh can also be installed with Thunderstore - you can find the mod [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/balatro/p/MathIsFun0/Ankh).

## Using Ankh
All runs uploaded to Speedrun.com with this mod must use its Official Mode, which you can find in the profile selection menu.
To reset runs with multiple segments, hold down Control+R instead of just R.
